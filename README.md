# Python MQTT Simulation üï∏Ô∏è

This repository contains a Python-based MQTT simulation tool designed to test and experiment with the MQTT protocol. Whether you're working on IoT projects or exploring publish-subscribe messaging patterns, this simulation provides a flexible and reliable environment.

---

## üéØ Features

- **Publish/Subscribe Simulation:** Mimics real-world MQTT messaging flows.
- **Customizable Topics:** Create, subscribe, and publish to custom MQTT topics.
- **Broker Interaction:** Seamlessly integrates with popular brokers like Mosquitto or HiveMQ.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverages `asyncio` for efficient message handling.
- **Extensibility:** Easily adapt the codebase for your specific needs.

## ‚ö° Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LazyDoomSlayer/python-mqtt-simulation
   cd python-mqtt-simulation
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the simulation script:
   ```bash
   python mqtt_simulation.py
   ```

## üîß Configuration

- Modify the **broker settings**, topic names, and payloads in the script to fit your use case.
- Example customization areas:
  - **Broker URL:** Update with your MQTT broker address.
  - **Topics:** Define your topics for publish/subscribe operations.
  - **QoS Levels:** Adjust the quality of service (QoS) settings as needed.

---

## üåü Use Cases

- **IoT Development:** Test and debug IoT devices using an MQTT broker.
- **Protocol Learning:** Understand how MQTT messaging works in practice.
- **Network Testing:** Simulate real-time messaging in controlled environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **paho-mqtt library** (included in `requirements.txt`)
- An MQTT broker for testing (e.g., [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org), [HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com)).
